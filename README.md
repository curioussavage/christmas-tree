Shared Game

Hey all,

I thought it would be pretty fun to start a game that we could share and just see how it takes off.  So . . . I created one.  Its kinda dumb but I think it will be a cool way to practice some skills and show off a bit.  

Start - 

My christmas tree sucks.  I need your help to beautify this thing.

Your job - 

Your need to keep my tree from sucking so bad.  Do this in anyway you see fit.  Add something (like and ornament or present), move something (make the tree taller and skinnier), change a color(of an ornament or present), make something link, or do something sweet like blow up, etc.  You can add whatever you want!  Get crazy.  However, only add or change one thing at a time.  Leave some cool stuff for other people to do.

Play - 

1. I have started the game and need to tag one of you.

2. Once youre tagged youll have to fork the repo, make changes, and then push to me. (be sure to comment your changes REALLY WELL!)  

3. Once you push it to me, then youll need to tag someone else.  Remember to give everyone a chance so dont keep picking the same people.
